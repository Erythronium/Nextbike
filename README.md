# ðŸš² Nextbike

Minimal wrapper around the Nextbike API to enable listing of all places (e.g. bike racks) and their available bike counts.

Looking for more info on bike sharing APIs in general? Check here â†’ [ubahnverleih/WoBike](https://github.com/ubahnverleih/WoBike).

## Installation

Nextbike is available through Carthage/Punic and Swift Package Manager, whatever floats your boat.

```swift
// Carthage
github "kiliankoe/Nextbike"

// Swift Package Manager
.package(url: "https://github.com/kiliankoe/Nextbike, from: "check tags/releases for the current version")
```

## Overview

Load all bikes current available in Dresden (id: 2) and print the count at the place "Bf. Dresden-Neustadt".

```swift
Nextbike.load(cityWithID: 2) { result in
    guard let countries = result.success else { return }
    let dresden = countries[0].cities[0]
    let bhfNeustadt = dresden.places.first { $0.name == "Bf. Dresden-Neustadt" }!
    print(bhfNeustadt.bikeCount)
}
```

## ToDo

There's a lot more info in the Nextbike API response. Would be great to pull that into the model types here as well. The info currently available is all I needed for integration into another app, so that's why it's so limited, sorry ðŸ™ˆ
